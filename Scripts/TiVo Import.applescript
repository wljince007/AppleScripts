TiVo Import
v1.0
Dov Frankel, 2013
http://dovfrankel.com

A Goldbergian script, which Hazel kicks off when TiVo Transfer moves over a recording, giving access to TiVo recordings on the AppleTV.

• Calls TiVo Decode to remove the TiVo DRM layer
• Calls HandBrake to convert it into an AppleTV-compatible mp4 file
• Adds it to iTunes
• Tags it with iFlicks
