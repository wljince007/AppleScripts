Upgrade Tracks

Replaces one track in iTunes with another version of the same one

If you, like me, are way too particular about metadata (specifically Date Added, Play Count, and other fields you don't have direct control over, this script might be worth a look. You select a track that's a newer version of one you already have (such as a high-bitrate AAC meant to replace a crunched-down mp3), and run the script. It will then:

• Attempt to automatically determine which track, or prompt you if there are multiple (or no) matches
• (Optionally) Copy over the tags you choose from the older track
• Merge soundtrack info (if you use the Grouping field to store tags, it will take a soundtrack tag on the original file and append it to the new track's tags, separated by a comma
• Combine the play counts of the two versions of the track
• Replace the file of the original track with that of the newer (selected) one, keeping it in all playlists it was always on
